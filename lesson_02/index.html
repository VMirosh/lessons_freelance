        <h2>Marriage and family</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Hanks married American actress Samantha Lewes (1952–2002) in 1978.
          They had one son, actor Colin (b. 1977), and one daughter, Elizabeth
          (b. 1982). Hanks and Lewes divorced in 1987. Lewes died in 2002 at the
          age of 49 from bone cancer. Hanks actively attends church. He said, "I
          must say that when I go to church—and I do go to church—I ponder the
          mystery. I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and
          'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to
          bad people' The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying
          theory of all mankind." In 1981, Hanks met actress Rita Wilson on the
          set of TV comedy Bosom Buddies (1980–1982). They were reunited in 1985
          on the set of Volunteers. Wilson is of Greek and Bulgarian descent,
          and a member of the Greek Orthodox Church. Before marrying her, Hanks
          converted to her faith. Hanks and Wilson married in 1988 and have two
          sons. Their older son, Chet, released a rap song in 2011 and had
          recurring roles in Empire and Shameless. Their younger son, Truman,
          was born in 1995, and portrayed the younger version of his father's
          character in A Man Called Otto (2022). Hanks lives with his family in
          Los Angeles, California, and Ketchum, Idaho.

            <h3>1980–1989 Early work, sitcom and comedy films</h3>
            <p>
              In 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film
              debut in the low-budget slasher film
              <a

                >He Knows You're Alone (1980)</a
              >
              He Knows You're Alone (1980) and landed a starring role in the
              television movie Mazes and Monsters (1982). Early that year, he
              was cast as the lead, Callimaco, in the Riverside Shakespeare
              Company's production of Niccolò Machiavelli's The Mandrake,
              directed by Daniel Southern. The following year, Hanks landed one
              of the lead roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC
              television pilot of Bosom Buddies. He and Peter Scolari played a
              pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they
              could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. Hanks had
              previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show Make Me
              Laugh. After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. Bosom
              Buddies ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never
              strong, television critics gave the program high marks. "The first
              day I saw him on the set," co-producer Ian Praiser told Rolling
              Stone, "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I
              knew he'd be a movie star in two years."

            <h3>1990–1999: Leading man</h3>
            <p>
              Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a
              washed-up baseball legend turned manager in Penny Marshall's A
              League of Their Own (1992). Hanks has said that his acting in
              earlier roles had not not great, but that he later improved. In an
              interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks called attention to what he
              called his "modern era of moviemaking ... because enough
              self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less
              pretentiously fake and over the top". This "modern era" began in
              1993 for Hanks, first with Nora Ephron's Sleepless in Seattle and
              then with Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia.

            <h3>2000–2009: Established star and expansion</h3>
            <p>
              Hanks reunited with Zemeckis for Cast Away (2000), playing a
              marooned FedEx systems analyst. Roger Ebert of The Chicago
              Sun-Times wrote: "Hanks proves here again what an effective actor
              he is, never straining for an effect, always persuasive even in
              this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and
              his body language when there's no one else on the screen."[74]
              Hanks co-directed and produced the Emmy Award-winning HBO
              miniseries Band of Brothers (2001). He also appeared in the
              September 11 television special America: A Tribute to Heroes and
              the documentary Rescued From the Closet. In 2002, he teamed up
              with Sam Mendes for Road to Perdition, an adaptation of the
              adaptation of Max Allan Collins's and Richard Piers Rayner's
              comics, in which he played an anti-hero role as a hitman on the
              run with his son. Hanks reunited with Spielberg, starring opposite
              Leonardo DiCaprio in Catch Me If You Can (2002), based on the true
              story of conman Frank Abagnale, Jr. Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson
              produced My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002). In August 2007, Hanks,
              along with co-producers Wilson and Gary Goetzman and writer and
              star Nia Vardalos, initiated a legal action against the production
              company Gold Circle Films for their share of profits from the
              movie. At the age of 45, Hanks became the youngest-ever recipient
              of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award on June
              12, 2002.

            <h3>2010–2019: Broadway debut and other roles</h3>
            <p>
              Hanks reprised his role of Woody in Toy Story 3 (2010) after he,
              Tim Allen and John Ratzenberger were invited to a movie theater to
              see a complete story reel of the movie. The film went on to become
              the highest-grossing animated film at the time. He executive
              produced the miniseries The Pacific (2010). In 2011, he directed
              and starred opposite Julia Roberts in the title role in the
              romantic comedy Larry Crowne. The movie received poor reviews,
              with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high
              ratings. Also in 2011, he starred in the drama Extremely Loud and
              Incredibly Close. In 2012, he voiced the character Cleveland Carr
              for a web series he created, Electric City. He played multiple
              parts in Cloud Atlas (2012), based on the novel of the same name
              by David Mitchell, and was executive producer of the miniseries
              Game Change

            <h3>2020–present</h3>
            <p>
              On April 11, 2020, Hanks made his first television appearance
              since his COVID-19 diagnosis by hosting Saturday Night Live. Hanks
              delivered an opening monologue via his house but did not appear in
              any of the sketches. This is the first episode of SNL to debut
              after the show's hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it features
              different sketches filmed remotely from the cast members' homes.
              This is also a first in SNL history, for the show to be made up
              entirely of prerecorded content before airing, and the second to
              not be filmed at Studio 8H. Hanks had two films released in 2020.
              Hanks starred in Greyhound, a war film which he also wrote the
              screenplay for. Initially set to be theatrically released in June
              2020 by Sony Pictures, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, distribution
              rights to the film were bought by Apple TV+, where it was released
              in July 2020. He reunited with Paul Greengrass for the Western
              News of the World. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter praised
              Hanks' performance: "Hanks has built a career out of playing
              thoroughly decent men, so his casting here is entirely to type.
              But the soulfulness and sorrow, the innate compassion that ripple
              through his characterization make this an enormously pleasurable
              performance to watch, with new depths of both kindness and regret
              that keep revealing themselves
